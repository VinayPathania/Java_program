        Difference between JRE , JVM , JDK


        JDK---
        1.The full form of JDK is Java Development Kit.
        2.JDK is a software development kit to develop applications in Java.
        3.JDK is platform dependent.
        4.It contains tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring java code.
        5.It is the superset of JRE
        6.The JDK enables developers to create Java programs that can be executed and run by the JRE and JVM.


        JRE---
        1.The full form of JRE is Java Runtime Environment.
        2.It is a software bundle which provides Java class libraries with necessary components to run Java code.
        3.JRE is also platform dependent.
        4.It contains class libraries and other supporting files that JVM requires to execute the program.
        5.It is the subset of JDK.
        6.The JRE is the part of Java that creates the JVM.


        JVM---
        1.The full form of JVM is Java Virtual Machine.
        2.JVM executes Java byte code and provides an environment for executing it.
        3.JVM is highly platform dependent.
        4.Software development tools are not included in JVM.
        5.JVM is a subset of JRE.
        6.It is the Java platform component that executes source code.
