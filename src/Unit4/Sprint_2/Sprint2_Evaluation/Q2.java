            //   // Explain the difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?
            //
            //    1. Uses :
            //            Method Overloading
            //    Method overloading is used to increase the readability of the program.
            //            Method overriding
            //    Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of the method that is already
            //    provided by its super class.
            //
            //    2. Performed :
            //            Method Overloading
            //    Method overloading is performed within class.
            //            Method overriding
            //    Method overriding occurs in two classes that have IS-A (inheritance) relationship.
            //
            //    3. Parameter :
            //            Method Overloading
            //    In case of method overloading, parameter must be different.
            //            Method overriding
            //    In case of method overriding, parameter must be same.
            //
            //    4. Example :
            //            Method Overloading
            //    Method overloading is the example of compile time polymorphism.
            //            Method overriding
            //    Method overriding is the example of run time polymorphism.
            //
            //
            //    5. Return type :
            //            Method Overloading
            //    In java, method overloading can't be performed by changing return type of the method only.
            //    Return type can be same or different in method overloading. But you must have to change the parameter.
            //            Method overriding
            //    Return type must be same or covariant in method overriding.
        }
