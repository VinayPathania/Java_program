        Static Variables vs Non-Static Variables


        Static---
        1.A static variable can be accessed by static members as well as non-static member functions.
        2.A static variable acts as a global variable and is shared among all the objects of the class.
        3.Static variables occupies less space and memory allocation happens once.
        4.A static variable is declared using static keyword.


        Non-Static---
        1.A non-static variable can not be accessed by static member functions.
        2.A non-static variables are specific to instance object in which they are created.
        3.A non-static variable may occupy more space. Memory allocation may happen at run time.
        4.A normal variable is not required to have any special keyword.
